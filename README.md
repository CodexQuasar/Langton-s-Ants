# Langtons Ants

Langton's Ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior.

## Description

This project is an implementation of Langton's Ant in [your programming language, e.g., Python, C++, etc.].  
It simulates the movement of the ant on an infinite grid following these basic rules:
- At a white square, turn right, flip the color of the square, move forward.
- At a black square, turn left, flip the color of the square, move forward.

Despite its simplicity, Langton's Ant produces surprisingly intricate patterns and is a classic example of emergent behavior.

## Features

- Configurable grid size
- Customizable number of steps
- Visualization of the ant's path (optional if implemented)
